To set up and maintain a direct link, both TDLS peer STAs shall be
associated with the same infrastructure
BSS.

A TDLS peer STA may be involved in direct links with multiple TDLS
peer STAs at the same time.
Simultaneous operation of DLS and TDLS between the same pair of STAs
is not allowed. A DLS Request
frame shall not be transmitted to a STA with which a TDLS direct link
is currently active. A DLS Request
frame received from a STA with which a TDLS direct link is currently
active shall be discarded.

TDLS shall not be used when the TDLS Prohibited subfield included in
the Extended Capability element of
the Association Response frame or Reassociation Response frame that
led to the current association is set
to one.

5) If a TDLS Setup Request frame is received from a TDLS responder STA
with which a currently
active TDLS session exists, then the receiving STA shall tear down the
existing TDLS direct link
as if a TDLS Teardown frame was received, and respond with a TDLS
Setup Response frame.


It is recommended that in general TDLS STAs propose target channels
that have no detectable medium
occupancy. If no such channel is available, then it is recommended
that the TDLS STA propose a target
channel where beacons are detected but with little or no additional
medium occupancy. It is further
recommended that TDLS STAs do not propose a target channel where the
presence of beacons indicate that
ACM bits are set, unless little or no additional medium occupancy is detected.
